This is the package of some customized functions written in R language. These are listed as follows:
- mybinom(): An R implementation designed to simulate and visualize the binomial distribution.
- myboot(): An implementation for performing a boostrap sample statistics simulation.
- myci(): Find the confidence interval from a data set.
- mycltu(): A histogram of the distribution of the sample mean. It applies the Central Limit Theorem in the Uniform distribution.
- mymaxlik(): Estimate the parameter values based on the Maximum Likelihood technique.
- myncurve(): Shade the area of probability in the normal distribution.
- mypvalue(): Display the P-value area, one of the criteria in the hypothesis testing besides the T-calc and confidence interval.
- ntickets(): Calculate the number of airline tickets to be sold in the overbooking situation based on the given number of seats in the flight.
